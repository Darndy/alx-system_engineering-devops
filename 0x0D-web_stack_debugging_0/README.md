Web stack debugging

Intro
Debugging usually takes a big chunk of a software engineerâ€™s time. The art of debugging is tough and it takes years, even decades to master, and that is why seasoned software engineers are the best at itâ€¦ experience. They have seen lots of broken code, buggy systems, weird edge cases and race conditions.


Test and verify your assumptions
Debugging is fun
Debugging can be frustrating, but it will definitely be part of your job, it requires experience and methodology to become good at it. The good news is that bugs are never going away, and the more experienced you become, trickier bugs will be assigned to you! Good luck ðŸ˜ƒ
